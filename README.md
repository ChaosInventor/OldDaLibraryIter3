# OldDaLibraryIter3

This is the third and final iteration of DaLibrary, a project that would later
turn into [DaLanguage](https://github.com/ChaosInventor/DaLanguage). This
iteration moved to C as C++ did not offer any substantially useful features
while adding extra complexity. C++ mainly failed in allowing for the automatic
conversion of interfaces and their implementations to another target interface.
DaLanguage was made because the structures and features of DaLibrary were far
too cumbersome to use, and because there was no way to leverage the large
information content in the [planned testing framework](https:github.com/ChaosInventor/OldTeFr).

This is an archive, I will not develop this project further.
