Welcome to DaLibrary's documentation!
=====================================

DaLibrary is a general purpose library written in C.

What sets DaLibrary apart, or in other words what its gimmicks are:

- Modularity, DaLibrary is written in such a way as to be able to customize
  which parts, or modules, will be used and built;
- Flexibility, DaLibrary's code is written to be as flexible as possible. This
  is achieved by using :ref:`interfaces <interfaceDef>` and by having
  :ref:`pure-ish functions <functionProperties>` like those in functional
  programming languages;
- Unique tests, this is thanks to DaLibrary's sister project
  :ref:`TF <externalTF>`

Here you'll find all documentation related to DaLibrary. Everything from module
references, concepts, examples, tutorials and more.
