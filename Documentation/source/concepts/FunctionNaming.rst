Function naming
===============

In DaLibrary, each function must follow a set of rules regarding its name.
Depending on what the function dose, there are 2 different function naming rules:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Commands.rst
    Statements.rst

Any functions that do not follow these rules are called
:ref:`deviants <Functions:Deviants>`.
