Commands
========

These sorts of functions do a specific action. Their names also sound like
commands, hence the name.

Structure
---------

Function names of this class are comprised of 3 parts:

1. Action, the first part that signifies what the function does. A single word
2. Arguments, the second part that encodes the function's argument list, as well
   as how those arguments are used. Multiple words with type names.
3. Elaboration

In the following order:

<Action><Arguments>_<Elaboration>

Action
------

The action is the the first part of the function name. It is a single word from
a :doc:`set of words <ActionsList>`. Each word has it's own meaning and it
defines what the function does, as well as how each argument is interpreted.

Elaboration
-----------

The elaboration is the last part of the function name. It is comprised of any
alpha-numeric characters as well as underscores. It is prefixed with an
underscore and added to the end of the function name. There are no restrictions
as to what this part of the function name may contain. It's meaning is left up
to interpretation.
