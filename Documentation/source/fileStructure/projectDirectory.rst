Project directory
=================

In order to start explaining the file structure of DaLibrary we have to start at
the **project directory**. The project directory is the directory in which the
entire DaLibrary repository is located, basically where .git folder is.

DaLibrary only requires this directory. All of its files, except for DaLibrary's
:ref:`dependencies <dependencies>`, are stored :term:`below` it.

The project directory holds the :ref:`main directories <mainDirDef>`. Aside from
the main directories, the project directory also holds dot-files, which are not
covered by this documentation.
