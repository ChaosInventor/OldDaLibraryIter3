Example
=======

An **example** file in DaLibrary is a file that holds any valid C code that
serves as an example. They may have any name and end in .e. Each file holds only
a single example. These files are meant to be either viewed by themselves or
displayed in documentation.

Contents
--------

These files may contain any valid C code. The only restriction is that they only
show an example of a single "thing". What that "thing" is, is left to
interpretation.
